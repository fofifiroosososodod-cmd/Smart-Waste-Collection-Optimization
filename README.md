# Smart Waste Collection Optimization

A blockchain-based smart contract system for optimizing waste collection through sensor-enabled bins and dynamic routing, creating more efficient and cleaner cities.

## Overview

Smart Waste Collection Optimization leverages IoT sensors and blockchain technology to revolutionize urban waste management. The system uses sensor-enabled bins to monitor fill levels and contamination, optimizes collection routes in real-time, and provides incentives for proper waste disposal practices.

## Key Features

### üóëÔ∏è Intelligent Bin Monitoring
- **Ultrasonic Fill-Level Sensing**: Real-time monitoring of bin capacity
- **Contamination Detection**: Advanced sensors to identify waste contamination
- **Automated Alerts**: Smart notifications when bins need attention

### üöõ Dynamic Route Optimization
- **Real-Time Route Planning**: AI-powered route optimization to minimize fuel consumption
- **Overflow Prevention**: Predictive analytics to prevent bin overflow incidents
- **Fleet Management**: Efficient coordination of collection vehicles

### üîç Smart Enforcement System
- **Image-Assisted Detection**: Computer vision for contamination identification
- **Educational Workflows**: Automated education campaigns for proper disposal
- **Fine Management**: Transparent and fair penalty system

### üéÅ Community Rewards Program
- **Recycling Incentives**: Token-based rewards for proper waste disposal
- **Community Engagement**: Gamification of waste reduction efforts
- **Diversion Rate Tracking**: Metrics-driven improvement programs
